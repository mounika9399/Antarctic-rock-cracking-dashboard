# Antarctic Rock Cracking – Tableau Dashboard Project

This project analyzes rock weathering in Antarctica using acoustic emission and meteorological data. Built using Tableau and guided by Dr. Jennifer Lamp (Columbia University).

## 🧩 Features
- Interactive dashboards with time-series, boxplots, and scatter plots
- Wind-speed filtering to remove sensor noise
- Conditional filters (temperature, humidity, irradiance)
- Rock-wise analysis and comparison of cracking behavior

## 🧪 Evaluation
Peer-reviewed with usability testing. Feedback improved dashboard clarity and interactivity.
