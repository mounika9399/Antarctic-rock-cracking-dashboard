# 🧊 Antarctic Rock Cracking – Tableau Dashboard Project

This project explores environmental triggers of rock weathering in Antarctica, using acoustic emission and meteorological data from the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The project was built using Tableau and conducted under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer Lamp (Columbia University) as part of a Visual Analytics course at UNC Charlotte.

---

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to identify how variables like wind speed, temperature, solar irradiance, and humidity influence internal rock cracking events using acoustic emission data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Tableau Public  
- Google Sheets / CSV  
- Scientific data (collected via sensors in Antarctica)  
- Peer usability testing and evaluation

---

## 📊 Features

- Interactive time-series dashboards for 4 rocks: Frankie, RBG, Theresa, and Pambi
- Wind speed filter to exclude noisy data
- Box plots and scatter plots with outlier detection
- Environmental condition filters (e.g., temperature < -5°C, RH between 40–60%)
- Rock-wise comparison of cracking behavior and energy release
